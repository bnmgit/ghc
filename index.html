<a name="intro" class="anchor" href="#intro"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Gephi is my tool of choice for graph visualization. And Hadoop stores all the data, in HDFS or HBase, accessable directly,
in Hive and HBase table, or via Impala in an SQL like style. Especially time dependent graph data can efficiently by partitioned
with Hive and all the large processing is done in Apache Giraph.</p>

<p>But now I have to load data from Hadoop into Gephi. Creation of graph files and transfer to the workstation was done regularly.
I had to repeat this steps manually all the time and important is, to remember the parameters which have been applied 
during processing or generation of the graph. This became a critical aspect over time and manual handling of all the 
files was not an option on the long term.</p>

<p>So I created the <b>Gephi-Hadoop-Connector</b>, which uses the JDBC-Interface provided by Impala and Hive, to load edge- and node-lists.</p>

<p>One really important feature in Gephi is: <i>it supports time dependent analysis and visualisation of networks.</i>
To build such a timeline, an individual query can be defined for each single time frame of each individual layer.
If data is already partitioned by time the whole procedure is really efficient.</p>

<p>Finally we have to think about: <i></i>How to handle all this metadata of a time dependent multilayer graph?</i> 
Therefore we use the Etosha-Graph-Metastore, which will be released soon.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
